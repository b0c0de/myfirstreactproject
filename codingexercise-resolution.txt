In this provided solution (see below), a new component function named MainGoal is created.

This function returns a <p> element that contains the text "My main goal: Learn React from the ground up.".

That's an important first step, because this code defines this custom component.

It does, however, not use this component yet.

To use it, you have to include it like a custom HTML element in the JSX code of some other component - in this case of the App component.

There, at very end of the returned JSX code, you'll find the <MainGoal /> component being used like a custom element. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import React from 'react';

// DEFINE YOUR COMPONENT HERE
// IMPORTANT: Add "export" in front of your component - otherwise the automated tests won't work
// ...
export const MainGoal = () => {
  return (
    <p>My main goal: Learn React in-depth and from the ground up, mastering its core concepts and best practices to build efficient and high-performance web applications.</p>
  );
};
// DO NOT EDIT THE APP COMPONENT NAME OR CONTENT
// Except for outputting your custom component

function App() {
  return (
    <div id="app">
      <h1>Time to Practice!</h1>
      <p>
        Build a <code>&lt;MainGoal&gt;</code> component and insert it below this
        text.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your <code>&lt;MainGoal&gt;</code> component should simply output some
        text that describes your main course goal (e.g., &quot;My main goal:
        Learn React in great detail&quot;).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> You custom component must contain the text
        &quot;My main goal:&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Also important:</strong> For the automatic checks to succeed,
        you <strong>must export</strong> your custom component function! Not as
        a default but simply by adding the <code>export</code> keyword in front
        of your function (e.g., <code>export function YOUR_COMPONENT_NAME</code>
        ).
      </p>
      {/* DON'T CHANGE THE TEXT / CONTENT ABOVE */}
      <MainGoal />
      {/* OUTPUT YOUR COMPONENT HERE */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
